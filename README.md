# Activate Zones
This is a module for [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk).

# Features
The module will set creatures in zones that have players in them as active.

This is a little like _SetAllCreaturesWithWaypointMovementActive_ but limited to specific zones.

It only works in Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, Outland and Northrend and it doesn't work if the _SetAllCreaturesWithWaypointMovementActive_ config option is enabled.
