# Activate Zones
This is a module for [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk).

# Features
The module will set creatures in zones that have players in them as active.

This is a little like _SetAllCreaturesWithWaypointMovementActive_ but limited to specific zones.

It only works in Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, Outland and Northrend and it requires the _PreloadAllNonInstancedMapGrids_ config option to be enabled.

# Important information
This module is currently broken and causes segmentation fault on startup. I don't have the time or energy to fix it for the time being and will get back to it eventually.

# Additional information
This module is part of my collection of modules.
